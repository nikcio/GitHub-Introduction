# Step 2 - Creating your first repository

By now you should have created an account and you're now ready to create your first repository also referred to as repo for short.

### What is a repository?
A repository is a place in which you store your code. It acts as a container for all of your files and creates an environment to create issues, collaborate, and much more.

### Creating my first repository

If you're not already on your profile page you can find it by clicking the avatar in the top right corner. Here you can also go directly to your repository.

[Find profile](../Assets/Images/create-repo/find-your-profile.png)

When on your profile you can navigate to your repository by clicking the Repositories button at the top of the page.

[Find Repositories](../Assets/Images/create-repo/find-repos.png)

Here you can press the New button to create your first repository.

When creating a new repo there are some things you need to fill out. You need to give the repo a name and decide if it should be publicly visible or private. The rest can be added later and will be explained further in some of the next steps.
