# Step 4 - Committing 

Now that we're familiar with GitHub Desktop we have to understand the concept of commits.

### What is a commit?
You can look at a commit like an update to your code, a package of changes to your files. What's special about a commit is that it's titled and can accompany a description of what changes were made. Thereby, it's possible to organize what code was changed.
To make a commit in GitHub Desktop we have to title our commit and press the commit button.

When you have pressed the blue button on the bottom left you'll have committed your changes but the changes haven't yet been uploaded to your GitHub repository. To do this you have to press the Push origin button. Now you're able to view your commit on the commit history on your repository. (To find the commit history visit [Step 7 - Navigating the repository](../Step%207%20-%20Navigating%20the%20repository/README.md))
